### Getting started:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/avantifellows/nex-gen-cms.git
   ```
2. Create `.env` file at project root directory.
3. Add following 2 key-value pairs in `.env` file.

   ```
   DB_SERVICE_ENDPOINT = http://localhost:4000/api/
   DB_SERVICE_TOKEN = <BEARER_TOKEN used in .env file of your local db-service project>
   ```
4. Navigate to the project directory.
 
   ```
   cd <path to local project root folder>
   ```
5. Run this command to download all necessary dependencies for the project.

   ```
   go mod tidy
   ```
6. Run the application by running:

   ```
   go run cmd/main.go
   ```
7. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080 to view the application.

### Temporary Branches to use until it gets merged to main:
1. **nex-gen-cms:** [feat/tests](https://github.com/avantifellows/nex-gen-cms/tree/feat/tests)
2. **db-service:** [adding-language-table](https://github.com/avantifellows/db-service/tree/adding-language-table)

### Tailwind Setup:
#### ‚úÖ Only Running the App?

You do **not** need to install Tailwind if you only want to run the app. The compiled Tailwind CSS (`output.css`) is already included and used in the HTML templates. Just run the Go server as usual and the styles will work out of the box.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Rebuilding Styles (Only if modifying Tailwind)?

If you make changes to `input.css` or `tailwind.config.js`, follow these steps:

```bash
npm install        # Install Tailwind and dependencies
npm run build:css  # Rebuild CSS
